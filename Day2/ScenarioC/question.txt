we want to create objects of multiple classes (which are part of inheritance hierarchy)

WE WOULD LIKE TO STORE ALL OBJECTS IN THE SAME CONTAINER 

ALL classes IN THE hierarchy HAVE COMMON FUNCTIONALITY USAUALLY DECLARED IN PARENT CLASS 

create a class bike with following attributes 

-bike_mileage which is float value 
_bike_type which is either commute,sports,atv

//3 locations reserved each location can store 8 bytes(address)
